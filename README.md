# üå≥ PDF Decision Tree Explorer

A web-based application that transforms **PDF playbooks** into interactive **decision trees** using **LLM + Vision APIs**.  
Users can upload a PDF or JSON, extract structured decision flows, and navigate them visually with expand/collapse controls.  

---

## üöÄ Features

- **PDF / JSON Input** ‚Äì Upload a playbook PDF or raw JSON.
- **LLM-Powered Extraction** ‚Äì Split PDF pages, convert to images, and extract decision nodes via OpenRouter LLM Vision API.
- **Tree Explorer** ‚Äì Navigate decisions, expand/collapse branches, and restart exploration.
- **Live Progress Overlay** ‚Äì See each PDF chunk being processed in real time.
- **Export Support** ‚Äì Download the extracted decision tree as JSON.
- **Responsive UI** ‚Äì Built with **Bootstrap 5** for a clean, modern interface.

## ‚ö° How It Works
The process flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Upload PDF or JSON] --> B{Input Type}
    B -->|PDF| C[Split into chunks + render to PNG]
    C --> D[Send images to LLM Vision API for extraction]
    B -->|JSON| E[Parse JSON input directly]

    D & E --> F[Merge extracted nodes into decision tree]
    F --> G[Initialize interactive explorer]

    G --> H[Expand/collapse branches & navigate]
    H --> I[Export decision tree as JSON]

```
1. Upload a PDF (split into chunks + processed via LLM) or provide raw JSON.
2.Extract structured decision nodes following a defined schema.
3.Merge extracted nodes into a unified decision tree.
4.Interactively explore: expand/collapse branches, track history, and restart at any point.
5.Export the final decision tree as JSON for reuse.
